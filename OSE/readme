1)---->            WHAT'S THAT?
-------------------------------

	The Open Sound Engine aims to be a complete audio engine, detached from 
interface libraries, suitable for audio programs (especially Dj oriented).
This is not a library, so you will not have something to compile but a
group of codefiles to be physically included in your package or linked. The coding
language is C++/C.



2)---->            REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

	Actually:
	
o)- libsndfile;


3)---->             DEVELOPMENT
-------------------------------

Please see the draft document.

o)-> WHO'S WORKING ON WHAT?

-- [ J_Zar ] Input classes;

All the rest could be coded by you!!! ;-D


4)---->                    TEST
-------------------------------

	In the "test" directory there is a test program, actually
very useful to tune code components. To build it you need "qmake",
included in the Qt library. Build with "./configure && make".
Read the "readme" file in the dir for more info.

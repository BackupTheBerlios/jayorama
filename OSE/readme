1)---->            WHAT'S THAT?
-------------------------------

	The Open Sound Engine aims to be a complete audio engine, detached from 
interface libraries, suitable for audio programs (especially Dj oriented).The coding
language is C++/C.



2)---->            REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

	Actually:
	
o)- libsndfile;
o)- qmake and QTDIR set;
o)- other... ;-(


3)---->                 INSTALL
-------------------------------

	To install OSE you need to have the QTDIR env variable correctly
set to your Qt environment. That is a little issue: OSE does not depend from
Qt library, because it is not a GUI library, except for the building
environment (QBASystem, written from me). After that simply try:

./configure
make
make install (as root or with proper rights)

Optionally you could try configuring with:

--double_engine		double precision float engine (default)
--float_engine		single precision float engine
--build_static		build library as static (actually unavailable)
--enable-jack		enable Jack sound server support


4)---->             DEVELOPMENT
-------------------------------

Please see the draft document.

o)-> WHO'S WORKING ON WHAT?

-- [ J_Zar ] Input classes: DecoderBase, SndFileDecoder;
-- [ J_Zar ] Output classes: OutputBase, RtAudioOutput;

All the rest could be coded by you!!! ;-D


5)---->                    TEST
-------------------------------

	In the "test" directory there is a test program, actually
very useful to tune code components. To build it you need "qmake",
included in the Qt library. Build with "./configure && make".
Read the "readme" file in the dir for more info.

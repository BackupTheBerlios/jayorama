 


		----->>>   CHANGELOG   <<<-----


Version UNKNOWN ---------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------


( 07-09-2004 )

o)+ Minor change to DecoderBase class: "open" becomes "openFile" to avoid
    name incompatibilities with STL;


( 06-09-2004 )

o)+ Draft version 0.2 with Dunstan Nesbit's todo points;


( 30-08-2004 )

o)+ The whole build environment is ready. Now it is possible to build
    libose in a shared way;
o)+ The output class has a major change: split into the platform base API 
    and the output object. Consequently: OutputAPIBase, OutputObjectBase.
    Respecting this design, coded RtAudio interface classes: almost working;
o)+ Important minor change to IzSound file DspUnit.h. Documented in the
    IzSound code directory;


( 17-08-2004 )

o)+ Added a draft of the OSEConfigManager class;


( 12-08-2004 )

o)+ All error codes and retvalues are now moved to common_def.h;


( 10-08-2004 )

o)+ RtAudioOutput now working! ;-) Ok... not correctly yet,
    but my soundcard grasp and I'm happy!;
o)+ Fixes at OutputBase;


( 09-08-2004 )

o)+ RtAudioOutput updated and corrected. The set up is ok but
    no working again;
o)+ Fixes at OutputBase;
    

( 07-08-2004 )

o)+ RtAudioOutput has been coded partially. Some issues to be
    thinked;
o)+ OutputBase class is almost working;
o)+ Changes in test code to build output stuff. Not
    working ;-( ;


( 06-08-2004 )

o)+ Changes in IzSound lib. File dspunit.h has been changed
    to follow the multiple audio data management (see
    readme.changes in the IzSound dir);
o)+ Added OutputBase class draft. Very confusing actually;


( 05-08-2004 )

o)+ Changes in DecoderBase for a double data management:
    float and double. Changes interest pcmWork function,
    destructor, constructor and addiction of m_audioFormat;
o)+ SndFileDecoder class adjust to follow DecoderBase changes;
o)+ Test changes to make the stuff work. DecMPADecoder is
    disabled till it will be useful;
o)+ Readme minor change to follow development description;



( 28-07-2004 )

o)+ Changed name and parameters for function "decode" in
    DecoderBase class;
o)+ Major changes to the DecoderBase class. Now pcm
    convertion and direction adjust is done here, in
    function "pcmWork";
o)+ Improved documentation for DecoderBase functions;



( 19-07-2004 )

o)* Project name and design changed;



( 02-07-2004 )

0)+ Coded DecoderBase class. Inherits DspUnit. Every decoding format
    class should inherit DecoderBase;

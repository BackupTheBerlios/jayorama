[ Introduction ]

IzSound is a stream-oriented sound processing library. It has been designed
around small DSP units that can be chained together to operate on the sound data
stream. While there are already several libraries of this kind, most of them are
either too simplists or too complicated. What's more, they are often written in
the C programming language and lead to libraries having a lot of functions and
data structures. Using an object oriented language can dramatically ease the
learning process by having a clearer overview.

That's why IzSound is written in C++ in order to use the object oriented
paradigms. Moreover, the C++ STL brings the concepts of generic programming and
IzSound makes an intensive use of both the containers and the algorithms brought
by the STL. This way it is built on both well tested data containers and
algorithmic bricks.

[ Components ]

IzSound in itself is a small library which defines the DspUnit class. This is
the base class of all the DSP units that can be plugged together to process the
sound data streams. This class embeds all the pluging logic, so it is very easy
to define a new DSP unit, the author has just to concentrate on the DSP job.

IzSound has a standard set of DSP units brought in a separate library
(libstdizdsp) which can read Ogg Vorbis files, crossfade two streams, actually
output the sound on your sound card, tweak the pitch and so on.

IzSound is published under a 3 clauses style BSD license. See the COPYING file
shipped along in the distribution for the exact terms.
